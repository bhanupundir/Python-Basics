        "### Key Features of Python:\n",
        "1. **Readable Syntax**: Python’s syntax is clean and easy to read, making it a great language for beginners and experienced developers alike.\n",
        "2. **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.\n",
        "3. **Dynamically Typed**: Variables don't need explicit declarations, as Python determines the type of a variable at runtime.\n",
        "4. **High-Level**: Python abstracts away most of the complexities of machine code, which allows developers to focus more on logic than on memory management.\n",

        "Ans--> In Python, lists are mutable and tuples are immutable primarily due to design choices that cater to different use cases. Here’s an explanation of why:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Performance Considerations:**\n",
        "   - **Lists (Mutable):** Lists are designed to be flexible and allow for changes in size or content. Since lists are commonly used for dynamic collections of items where elements may need to be added, removed, or modified, having them mutable provides performance advantages in these scenarios.\n",
        "   - **Tuples (Immutable):** Tuples, on the other hand, are optimized for fixed, constant collections of items. By making tuples immutable, Python can provide optimizations like faster access times, reduced memory usage, and safety guarantees (i.e., the content won’t change unexpectedly).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Semantic Intent:**\n",
        "   - **Lists:** The use of lists implies that the data can change. For example, lists are often used in algorithms that modify or update their contents over time.\n",
        "   - **Tuples:** Tuples, on the other hand, are typically used to represent data that should not change after it is created. This is particularly useful in cases like returning multiple values from a function, or using them as keys in dictionaries (since their immutability guarantees consistency and hashability).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Hashability:**\n",
        "   - Since lists are mutable, they cannot be used as dictionary keys because their content could change, leading to inconsistent hash values. Tuples, being immutable, can be hashed and used as keys, ensuring they maintain integrity across their usage in data structures like sets and dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, **lists are mutable** to provide flexibility for dynamic data manipulation, while **tuples are immutable** to offer a more stable, optimized option for representing fixed data and ensuring hashability and safety."

        "Ans--> Implicit and explicit type casting are two methods used to convert one data type into another in programming. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Implicit Type Casting (Automatic Type Casting)**\n",
        "- **Definition**: Implicit type casting is automatically done by the compiler or interpreter without the programmer's intervention. It typically occurs when converting a lower data type to a higher one (e.g., from `int` to `float`).\n",
        "- **When**: This happens when there's no risk of data loss or overflow. For example, converting from an integer to a floating-point number is safe and automatic.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    int_value = 5\n",
        "    float_value = int_value  # Implicit casting from int to float\n",
        "    print(float_value)  # Output: 5.0\n",
        "    ```\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. **Explicit Type Casting (Manual Type Casting)**\n",
        "- **Definition**: Explicit type casting requires the programmer to specify the conversion. This is often needed when converting from a higher data type to a lower one (e.g., from `float` to `int`), or when there's a possibility of losing data during the conversion.\n",
        "- **When**: This happens when the conversion might result in a loss of information, and the programmer must ensure that the conversion is intentional.\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    float_value = 5.75\n",
        "    int_value = int(float_value)  # Explicit casting from float to int\n",

        "    ```\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans--> Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions.

        "Ans--> The `elif` (short for \"else if\") statement is used in Python to check multiple conditions in an `if-else` chain. It allows you to check for more than two conditions without writing nested `if` statements. Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The program evaluates the condition in the `if` statement first.\n",
        "2. If the `if` condition is `True`, it runs the block of code associated with the `if` and skips the rest of the `elif` and `else` statements.\n",
        "3. If the `if` condition is `False`, it then checks the condition in the first `elif` statement.\n",
        "4. If the `elif` condition is `True`, it executes the block of code under `elif` and skips the rest of the statements.\n",
        "5. If none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`, the program executes the code under the `else` statement (if it exists).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "    print(\"x is 5 or less\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- The program first checks if `x > 20`. Since `x = 10`, this condition is `False`, so it moves to the `elif` statement.\n",
        "- It then checks if `x > 5`. Since `x = 10`, this condition is `True`, so it prints `\"x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 20\"`.\n",
        "- The `else` block is not reached because the `elif` condition was `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the `elif` statement allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence after the initial `if` condition."
